Problem statement

Design Cache system. We have to support two operations:
    PUT: This will allow user to put a value against key in the cache
    Get: allow user to get previously saved value using key
    Eviction: Remove keys

Expectations:
    code should be functionally correct
    modular and readable
    extensible and scalable
    OOPs designs
